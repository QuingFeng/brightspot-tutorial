## Start

This directory contains the results of the Basic Article tutorial. Readers can compare their tutorial results with this one. In addition, readers who want to work through the Styleguide tutorial but not the Basic Article tutorial can use this directory as a starting point.

Clone this repository or [download the zip](https://github.com/perfectsense/brightspot-tutorial/archive/master.zip), change to the `hello-world` directory, and run the following command: 

**OSX / Linux**

```
    ./run.sh
```

**Windows**

```
    run.cmd
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:9480`. It should automatically open your default browser and navigate to the Brightspot login page at: `http://localhost:9480/cms`.
