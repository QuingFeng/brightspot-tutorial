This directory contains the results of the Styleguide tutorial. Readers can compare their tutorial results with this one. 

Clone this repository or [download the zip](https://github.com/perfectsense/brightspot-tutorial/archive/master.zip), change to the `hello-styleguide` directory, and run the following command: 

**OSX / Linux**

```
    ./run.sh
```

```
    run.cmd
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:9480`. It should automatically open your default browser and navigate to the Brightspot login page at: `http://localhost:9480/cms`.
